                <p class="par" style="background: rgba( 0, 0, 0.897, .5);">IT, also known as information technology, indicates the transfer or other uses of information through computers or computer systems. 
                    <br>IT professionals perform a number of different tasks, they are the people who test, build, install, repair, or maintain the hardware and software associated with complex computer systems in one or more locations. <br>
                    <br>Some companies will hire several IT professionals throughout the world in order to maintain their wide range of networks of computer systems. 
                    <br>The nature of the internet allows IT professionals to do their jobs from any location. However, in circumstances such as hardware issues, IT professionals will need to physically alter the broken system in order to carry out necessary repairs.
                    <br>Once an IT professional is employed, they will constantly be acquiring new IT skills and training. This is because not every company that IT professionals service will use the same coding language, operating system, database tool, or methodology.
